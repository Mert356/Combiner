AI-Based Outfit Combiner App
This app allows users to upload or take photos of clothing items and uses AI to suggest outfit combinations. The app cuts out clothing from the background, classifies them, and provides outfit suggestions based on the user's wardrobe. Users can share their combinations with others and explore what others are wearing.

Features
Photo Upload & Capture: Users can either upload images from their gallery or capture photos using their device’s camera to add clothing items to the app.
Clothing Segmentation & Transparent Background: Uploaded or captured images are processed to isolate clothing from the background, leaving the background transparent.
Clothing Labeling & Classification: The AI algorithm automatically tags and classifies the clothing items, making it easier to organize and search.
Outfit Suggestions: Based on the user's wardrobe, the AI suggests possible outfit combinations, helping users mix and match their clothes.
User Profile: Each user has a profile page where they can view their uploaded clothing items and shared outfits.
Tech Stack
Frontend: Kotlin Jetpack Compose
